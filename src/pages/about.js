                It can be difficult to know which companies are hiring your
                students and the kinds of offers that they are making. Prospect

              <h3>Visualizing the big picture</h3>

                LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Handshake and Indeed.com. Prospect pulls
                information from sites like these to make it easy for you to see
                the big picture.
